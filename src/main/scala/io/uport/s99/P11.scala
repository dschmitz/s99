P11 (*) Modified run-length encoding.
Modify the result of problem P10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates are
transferred as (N, E) terms.
Example:
scala> encodeModified(List('a, 'a, 'a, 'a, 'b, 'c, 'c, 'a, 'a, 'd, 'e, 'e, 'e, 'e))
res0: List[Any] = List((4,'a), 'b, (2,'c), (2,'a), 'd, (4,'e))
